# Round Weather Display

This fork, **ESP32 Weather Alarm Clock**, is preparing alarm and DS3231 backup-time support, a redesigned interface, and expanded Night Shift settings for the ESP32-P4. Firmware implementation has not started. See the [architecture and contracts](docs/wac/architecture.md), [approved interface map](docs/wac/screen-state-map.md), and [repository and original-baseline setup](docs/wac/repository-setup.md). The original project's documentation follows below.

For development in this fork, start with the [project instructions](AGENTS.md), [development policy](docs/wac/development.md), and [ESP32 build and test instructions](targets/esp32-p4/README.md). The architecture defines the approved new-file boundary.

A round clock and weather display for your nightstand, desk, or anywhere you want to keep an eye on the time and weather.

Pick an analog or digital clock face, swipe over to see the forecast and current conditions, or leave a message for someone at home. When stormy weather is on the way, the clock lets you know. Weather comes from Open-Meteo, with no API key needed.

You can build it with a Raspberry Pi and round HDMI touchscreen, or use the Waveshare ESP32-P4 board with its own round display. Both versions have the same clock faces, weather, and household messaging.

## ✨ Features

- Analog and digital clock faces
- 12-hour or 24-hour time, with an optional leading zero
- Current weather and a five-day forecast
- Forecast icons that reflect how most of the day looks
- A conditions screen with wind, pressure, and rain in plain language, like "Rain ending by 4 PM" or "Pressure dropping fast"
- Storm alerts: an amber glow on the clock face when strong winds, thunderstorms, heavy rain, or a sharp pressure drop are on the way
- A small indicator when the weather data is out of date
- Optional red nightshift mode for a dimmer nighttime display
- Household messages you can send from your phone or computer
- Shared messaging between multiple clocks, including a mix of Pi and ESP32-P4 builds
- Settings and WiFi setup from the touchscreen
- Automatic startup when you power it on

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Raspberry Pi

Start with Raspberry Pi OS installed and the Pi connected to your network. Run these commands on the Pi, either in a terminal or over SSH.

Download the installer:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Canterrain/round-weather-display/main/setup.sh
```

Run it:

```bash
bash setup.sh
```

Choose **Raspberry Pi** when asked. The installer will walk you through your location, room name, clock face, temperature units, message sharing, and nightshift settings.

It downloads the project, installs what it needs, saves your settings, and sets up the clock to start automatically.

When it finishes, reboot:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

The clock should appear after the Pi starts back up.

### ESP32-P4

You can install this version straight from your browser. Use Chrome, Edge, or Firefox on a desktop or laptop.

1. Plug the board into your computer with a USB-C data cable.
2. Open the [Round Weather Display installer](https://canterrain.github.io/round-weather-display/).
3. Click the connect button, choose your board, then click **Install**.
4. Once it finishes and restarts, use the touchscreen to set up WiFi, your location, and your clock preferences.

For updates, plug the board back into your computer and use the same installer. Wireless updates aren't available yet.

## Using the Clock

Your chosen clock face is the home screen. Everything else is one or two swipes away from it:

| From | Gesture | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Clock | Swipe left | Open the forecast, then the conditions screen |
| Forecast or conditions | Swipe right | Go back toward the clock |
| Clock | Swipe right | Open messages |
| Messages | Swipe left | Return to the clock |
| Clock | Swipe down | Open Settings |
| Settings | Swipe up, or tap Cancel | Return to the clock |

Tap an unread message to mark it read and return to the clock.

### Conditions and storm alerts

The conditions screen leads with a short headline about what matters most right now, such as "Calm and dry", "Thunderstorms likely by 4 PM", or "Much colder tomorrow". Below it are a wind compass and a quick summary of wind, pressure, and rain.

When strong gusts, high winds, thunderstorms, heavy rain or snow, or a sharp pressure drop are expected within the next few hours, the clock face shows an amber glow on its right edge. During an alert, one swipe left opens the conditions screen first, and the forecast is one more swipe away.

### Settings

Swipe down from the clock to change the weather location, room name, device ID, house messages, clock face, time format, units, and nightshift. Tap **Wi-Fi** to pick a network. **Save & Restart** applies your changes. The Pi and ESP32-P4 have the same settings screen.

On the Pi, the WiFi screen also opens automatically when the clock loses its connection.

## 💬 Household Messages

You can leave a message on the clock from a browser on the same home network. Open the address for your device:

**Raspberry Pi:**

```text
http://<hostname>.local:3000/messages
```

For example, if you named your Pi `bedroom-clock`, use `http://bedroom-clock.local:3000/messages`.

**ESP32-P4:**

```text
http://<device-ip>/
```

Replace `<device-ip>` with the clock's IP address.

If you have more than one clock, enable shared messaging during setup. Give each one a room name so it's easy to choose where a message goes. Pi and ESP32-P4 clocks can share messages with each other.

## ⚙️ Configuration

The Pi installer creates your settings file at:

```text
~/round-weather-display/targets/pi/config.json
```

Most settings can be changed on the clock itself (swipe down from the clock face). You can also run the installer again. It uses your existing settings as the defaults and backs up the previous config in `~/round-weather-display-backups/`.

If you'd rather edit the file yourself, these are the main options. The [example config](shared/spec/config.example.json) includes the full set.

| Setting | What it controls |
| --- | --- |
| `defaultClockFace` | `analog` or `digital` |
| `timeFormat` | `12` or `24` |
| `leadingZero12h` | `true` for `07:00 AM`, `false` for `7:00 AM` |
| `units` | `imperial` for Fahrenheit, `metric` for Celsius |
| `roomName` | The name shown in the message controls, such as `Kitchen` |
| `deviceId` | A unique name used to identify this clock when sharing messages |
| `messageSharing` | `single` for just this clock, or `shared` for household messaging |
| `nightShift` | `true` to enable the dim red nighttime mode |
| `nightShiftStart` / `nightShiftEnd` | When nightshift runs, such as `22:00` to `06:00` |
| `stormGustMph` / `stormGustKmh` | Optional. Gust speed that triggers a storm alert (default 40 mph / 64 km/h) |
| `stormWindMph` / `stormWindKmh` | Optional. Sustained wind that triggers an alert (default 25 mph / 40 km/h) |
| `stormPressureDropHpa` | Optional. Pressure drop over 3 hours that triggers an alert (default 3 hPa) |
| `stormPrecipMmHr` | Optional. Hourly rain or snow that counts as heavy (default 7.6 mm) |

On the ESP32-P4, change your settings on the touchscreen: swipe down from the clock face.

## 🛠️ Development Notes

The Raspberry Pi version uses Electron and Express. The ESP32-P4 version uses ESP-IDF and LVGL. The code for each lives in its own folder:

| Path | What's there |
| --- | --- |
| `setup.sh` | Raspberry Pi installer; also launches ESP32-P4 setup from a full checkout |
| `targets/pi/` | Raspberry Pi app, web pages, and launch scripts |
| `targets/esp32-p4/` | ESP32-P4 firmware and build scripts |
| `shared/` | Weather icons, shared weather logic, config example, and behavior notes |
| `docs/` | Browser installer and downloadable ESP32-P4 firmware |

To run the Pi app from a checkout with its dependencies installed:

```bash
npm start
```

To build and flash the ESP32-P4 from source, connect the board over USB and run this from the repo root:

```bash
targets/esp32-p4/scripts/setup.sh
```

The script installs ESP-IDF `v5.5.5` if needed, builds the firmware, and flashes the board. You can also use it for updates. More details are in the [ESP32-P4 README](targets/esp32-p4/README.md).

Run the weather and location checks for both versions with:

```bash
npm run test:all
```

You can also run `npm run test:forecast`, `npm run test:location`, `npm run test:conditions`, or `npm run test:esp32-parity` separately. See the [test notes](targets/esp32-p4/tests/README.md) for details and the [shared behavior spec](shared/spec/product-spec.md) for how the clock screens should work.
